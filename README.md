The production of coffee plants can be affected by different factors such as pests, diseases, and nutritional deficiencies for that reason, the early identification of any of these factors is important. These factors can be detected through leaves, stems, or berries, however, if the plant has any spot or affected area, it is usually related to a disease, leaving behind the lack of nutrients such as boron, calcium, iron, magnesium, manganese, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and others. Implementing deep learning methods that can classify leaves of coffee plants according to nutritional deficiencies is a challenge when it comes to with a small dataset. The proposed research is designed on using Convolutional Neural Networks-based model and different Transfer Learning Techniques, which allow to farmers provide the sufficient nutrients to coffee plants and prevent low quality of production. This research uses a combination of two datasets, CoLeaf dataset includes 1,290 images split into ten categories of boron (B), Calcium (C), Iron (Fe), Magnesium (Mg), Manganese (Mn), Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (P), Others and Healthy leaves. No disease file was added to this research from Coffee Plant disease dataset. Data Augmentation were implemented, followed by five transfer learning techniques for training models such as VGG-16, ResNet-50, DenseNet-121, MobileNet-V2 and Inception-V3. Results of the five models are presented in this paper based on accuracy and loss. At first instance this model shows best performance in VGG-16 and ResNet-50 in training dataset with an accuracy of 99.16% and 95.85% respectively, however , fine-tuned model displays better performance in ResNet-50 with an accuracy of 99.83% whilst VGG-16 obtains 99.69% of accuracy.
